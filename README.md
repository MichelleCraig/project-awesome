NPM for Project Awesome core functions

Project Awesome core functions include automatic quiz/exam question generation.

This does NOT contain the User Interface.  

Only:
* validation of JSON quiz descriptor syntax
* generation of questions and answers from a qd and key
* formatting of questions/answers into various formats (TODO: check this.  Does this happen here, or in the other part of the app?)

# How to Run Tests

```
npm install
npm test
